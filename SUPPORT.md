# Titan Community Support

The Titan community home can be found at [titan-data.io](https://titan-data.io).
There you can find a [getting started](https://titan-data.io/getting-started)
guide as well as [documentation](https://titan-data.io/docs).

To connect with members of the community, head over to the
[community page](https://titan-data.io/community) where you can
[join](https://join.titan-data.io) the slack workspace. There, you can
ask questions and get help. If you're not sure whether something is a bug
or not, be sure to ask there first.

If you're sure that something is a bug or feature request, you can submit
an issue that will then become the point of further collaboration. Be sure
to watch issues and respond if there are any follow-up questions.
